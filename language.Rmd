## Dyads and triads

In empirical (migration) literature: \alert{dyads}---being a group of two things/people/firms:

  - origin-destination
  - push & pull factors
  - gravity models with distance-decay
    
In network theory: \alert{triads}---being a group of three things (persons):

  - cycles (as opposed to dyads)
  - network formation
  
## Triads can have \alert{closure}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.1\columnwidth]{affiliation}

## Which leads to \alert{homophily} \citep{manskiIdentificationEndogenousSocial1993}

Birds of a feather flock together---three factors at work which are very difficult to identify:

- Social interaction (\alert{endogeneous} effect)
- Selection (\alert{exogeneous} effect)
- Contextual (\alert{confounding}) effect

Example: native language adoption of immigrants

- Do immigrants learn a native language because their peers do?
    - triadic closure
  
- Do language learners seek others company
    - sorting/self-selection (based upon unobservables?)
  
- Do contextual effects invoke some groups to adopt a language
  - Local school subsidies

## Homophily, weak and strong ties

## Why bother with language?

```{=tex}
\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{.5\textwidth}
Language facilitates \alert{economic} exchange
\begin{itemize}
\item Common language increases international trade with 20\% \citep{grootInstitutionalDeterminantsBilateral2004} to 50\% \citep{melitzLanguageForeignTrade2008}
\item Linguistic common roots across Europe correlates highly with \alert{trust} \citep{yuTradeTrustRule2015}
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{.5\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width = 1.0\textwidth]{tree}
\end{column}
\end{columns}
```
## Why bother with language (part II)?

Language facilitates \alert{cultural} exchange \citep{ginsburghEconomicsLanguage2020}

- language often proxies culture \citep{stulzCultureOpennessFinance2003}
- language proxies \alert{slow-changing} culture
    
    - adopting a new language invokes large costs
    - ones own language learned within the household
    
- type of language (pronouns, the gender associated with words) \alert{might} be correlated with socio-economic behaviour---Sapir-Whorf hypothesis \citep{ginsburghEconomicsLanguage2020}

## Language adoption---stylized facts (PEW research, 2019)

\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{linguistic_diversity}
    
## Language adoption---stylized facts II 

For 2018, the migration observatory noted for the UK 

- From 3,200,000 foreign-born adults, 1,600,000 speak English as first language at home

- 320,000 of the foreign-born reported experiencing problems in work or education as a result of their limited English language skills

- Use of English increases over time: in 2018, about 68% of the foreign-born population residing in the UK for at least 15 years had English as their first language at home, up from 29% of those who had been in the country for 0--2 years

## Returns to using a language

## Returns to using a language II

- For migrants: Being able to speak the native language is key to integration and returns on the labor market     
    - +20\% (Chiswick and Miller, 1995), +35\% (Chiswick, 1999) and +33\% (Bleakley and Chin, 2004, 2010) on earnings

- For natives: Being able to speak a foreign language is an important human capital asset}
    - +3/+5\% on earnings (Williams, 2011), (much) higher conditional on the share of people speaking that language (Ginsburgh and Prieto-Rodriguez, 2010)
	- English in a growing number of professions, but specific languages (Mandarin, French, Russian) for specific professions/firms


## Returns to foreign language and educational level

## A cost-benefit approach to language adoption

\begin{columns}
\column{2in}
Individual benefits
\begin{itemize}
    \item higher wages
    \item less unemployment
\end{itemize}
Individual costs
\begin{itemize}
    \item time/effort
    \item opportunity costs
\end{itemize}

\column{2in}	
\includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{network_size}
\end{columns}

## Decreasing benefits in community size?

So, in strong \alert{communities} with high bonding capital (strong ties) and less bridging capital (weak ties)

- language proficiency decrease \citep{lazearCultureLanguage1999}

- depends on spatial scale, for neighborhoods yes, for cities no \citep{floraxSpatialEconomicPerspective2005}

- communities not only the place where people live, but also where they work \citep{beckhusenLivingWorkingEthnic2013}

## Measurement issues---MAUP!

\end{columns}


## Policy issues

Language proficiency is beneficial for the individual---but sometimes incentives too low because of persistent network formation

Possible policies

- decrease costs: schooling at the national level (note that schooling in a different language increases identity---well documented are Basque, Catalan, Arabic and Frisian languages)
- increase incentives: higher wages/job probability when able to speak the native language
- moving permits for social housing
- transitory?
